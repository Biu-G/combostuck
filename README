ATTENTION:
if you're just a normal user but not a developer, follow instructions below:
usage:
1.git clone this repo
2.download hacker.apk in the root directory
3.install hacker.apk into your android phone
4.run the installed app: push start button -> wait for a few seconds(as short as you want) -> push stop button -> upload record
5(optional).you'll notice no matter how long you've run for actually even if for 0.5 meters, you always upload the record of 5km+
6(optional).to vertify the record if you don't believe: uninstall this hacked app and install an official pku runner instead, you'll still
receive the fake records you've created on the hacked app. So that means what is fake is not dependent on the version of app but is already
printed on server. Hack successfully! You saved the time wasted on running meaninglessly.


for developers only:

for others fake(change) when save to database(in Data.savetodatabase ch Record)


for json fake(create) when upload to server(in Network.uploadtoserver ch Point)//Dont take from db!!just yourself
//for its calculated just between points you've got .you can just make serveral! and move not smoothly
